# Machine-learning-Wholesale-Customer-Dataset
 Goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with.
 
We compleated this goal by:
- implement Feature Scaling to Normalize the data.
- Finding optimal number of features using RFECV and show the plot between Number of features
selected vs Cross validation score
- Implementing KMeans Clustering for K=2 to K=15 and using the elbow method identify what is the
optimum number of clusters
- Implementing PCA with number of original features to answer how much variance is explained by
first 2 components and by first 4 components and visualize the clusters in the data
- Implement XGBoost Classifier with 5 Fold CV and report the performance metrics
